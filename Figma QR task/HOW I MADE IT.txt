                                      How I made it
Hello world.This is my first ever html/css project.Been learning html/css for 1.5 weeks and even diving into it.
I used Reset.css because as we know different browsers got different properties into their codes for styling html elements,so to get rid of 
deffault properties I set everything to 0 by using reset.css and then started making my own styles for this project using class and id 
selectors.This is my first figma project.I hope you like this.
Thanks for your attention.
